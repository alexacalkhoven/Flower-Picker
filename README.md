# Flower-Picker

This simple neural network will tell you if you're describing a rose or a sunflower

## Instructions
To test the flower identification neural net, make up input data with the following assumptions:

Size is quantified on a scale from 1-10, 1 being the smallest, 10 being the largest.

Roses are most often red, sometimes pink or white, and rarely yellow. 
Roses are almost always scented.
Roses tend to be smaller than sunflowers, often a 0-5.

Sunflowers are almost always yellow.
Sunflowers are usually not scented.
Sunflowers tend to be bigger than roses, often 6-10.
